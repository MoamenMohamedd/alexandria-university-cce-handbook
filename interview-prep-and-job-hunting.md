## Quick Intro
This will include a lot of interview prep material (mostly links). One thing we’d also like to promote is **the importance of hustling** for getting a job and of investing as much time job hunting as one would invest in the interview prep. That’s often overlooked despite being so counter intuitive. So, this will also include some links to communities and job websites and not only prep material

## Good Problem Listings
- ## [Cracking The Coding Interview](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/)
  Very good starting point for coding interview preparation. It walks you through building a preparation plan, understanding what to expect in coding interviews, and ensuring that you are approaching problem solving the right way and not wasting your time.
- ### [Leetcode's blind curated 75](https://leetcode.com/list/xoqag3yj/)
  Make sure you solved everything here before interviewing season. This is the most popular list out there and it's very broad covering the most touched on topics.

- ### [Dynamic programming patterns](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/458695/dynamic-programming-patterns/439810?page=2)
  This is a great place to practice dp problems divided by category. I'd also recommend 2 things there:

    1. Make sure you can always code bottom up iterative solutions. Don't be lazy with recursion + memoization only because that ability to write iterative solutions is how you will understand dp completely.
    2. Watch [MIT 6.006's 4 lectures on Dynamic programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQ5jsbhAv_M&list=PLUl4u3cNGP61Oq3tWYp6V_F-5jb5L2iHb&index=20&t=0s) and understand what the "sub problem dependency DAG" is.

  These might be too much for internship interviews, but definitely practice dp a lot for full time.

- ### [How to effectively use leetcode to prepare for interviews](https://leetcode.com/discuss/career/449135/How-to-effectively-use-LeetCode-to-prepare-for-interviews)
  The must solve easy problems on that list are especially great. The easy problems on leetcode, that have tricky corner cases or limit on space used, get asked a lot on interviews.
- ### Other Lists and resources
    1. [Another curated list](https://seanprashad.com/leetcode-patterns/) of 160+ questions tagged by company.
    2. Closer to interview day: [questions by cram score](https://jeremyaguilon.me/blog/ranking_interview_questions_by_cram_score).

## Communities
- ### [HH Coding Interview Prep on Facebook](https://m.facebook.com/profile.php?id=722062947858000&ref=content_filter) (less active these days)
  Join the group on Facebook, to see what everybody is studying and where they are interviewing (which indicates which places are hiring)

- ### [CS Career Questions on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/)
  Probably the most used community by CS professsionals and students right now. Make sure to also join the [EU version](
